## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone this repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gers08/testnet-automation.git
cd testnet-automation
npm install
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following variables:

```env
USER_ADDRESS=your-wallet-address
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key
```

### 3. Configure the automation behavior in src/constant/config.js:

```js
ACTION_WEIGHTS: {
    Swap: 82,            // relative weight for Swap (82%)
    TransferToken: 15,   // 15%
    DeployToken: 1,      // 1%
    DeployNFT: 1,        // 1%
    DeployContract: 1,   // 1%
},

AMOUNT_OF_LIQIUDITY: 200, // amount of liquidity to add to the pool (both USDT and USDC)
    SWAP_MIN_AMOUNT: 1,    // minimum token amount to swap
    SWAP_MAX_AMOUNT: 10,   // maximum token amount to swap
```

### 4. Add Liquidity Pool Addresses in `src/constant/addresses.js`:

```bash
npm run add-liquidity-pool
```

### 5. Add transfer recipient addresses in `src/constant/addresses.js`:

```js
TRANSFER_RECIPIENTS: [
    "",
    // add more addresses as needed
],
```

### 6. Start the automation script:

```bash
npm run automate-pharos
```

## Notes

- Ensure your wallet has enough testnet funds (PHRS, USDC, USDT) for gas and operations.
- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control.
- Designed for Pharos testnet only ‚Äî do **not** use mainnet keys or endpoints.
